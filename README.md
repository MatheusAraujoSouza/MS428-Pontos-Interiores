# MS428-Pontos-Interiores
MS428 project (Linear programming), carried out in 2019,
Implementation of the interior points algorithm (Predictor-Corrector Method)
With a small change in the method used in linear programming, the correcting predictor (now updated to a method called path tracker), are internal changes
algebraic structure in the development of the algorithm.
Interior point methods are the most efficient in linear programming, being the most powerful in this very broad area of research and applications.
